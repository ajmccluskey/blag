A few nights ago I was setting up my new fileserver (post to come soon) when I heard something like fireworks on my street.  Upon further investigation I saw big flashes which were going off in time with the exploding sounds.  After a little while I saw that people were down on the street watching whatever the show was, so I went down and got some footage.  For the record this was in Kenmore Hills some time around 2-3am on 14 Jan 2009.  If anyone knows what this is, please let me know via email or in the comments.
