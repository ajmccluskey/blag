For the really geeky amongst you, here's a [pretty good article](http://www.cygnus-software.com/papers/comparingfloats/comparingfloats.htm) explaining some of the issues and approaches relating to floating point comparisons in C/C++.

On a side note, I'm almost done with my uni assignments for this semester.  I'm hoping to post a few articles based on stuff I've encountered this semester once I get into exam period/holidays.

That is all.
