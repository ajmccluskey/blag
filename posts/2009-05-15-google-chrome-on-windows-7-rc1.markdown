This is just a quick post for anyone having difficulties getting Chrome to run on Windows 7 RC1.  After installing Chrome, as soon as I tried to load a page it would either do nothing, or show me an "Aw Snap" page telling me something had gone wrong.  As a result, the browser was completely useless.  A quick search revealed that users can subscribe to one of three different [Chrome channels](http://dev.chromium.org/getting-involved/dev-channel).  These channels are basically the three main builds of Chrome at a given time, which are: stable, beta, and dev.  The quick solution to my problem was to switch over to the beta channel, which immediately fixed my problem.  As proof, I'm currently writing this post using Chrome =D.  Given that Windows 7 is still only at RC1, it's not surprising that the stable build of Chrome doesn't work with it (at least not for everyone).

As a side note, you should definitely check out [Chrome Experiments](http://www.chromeexperiments.com) to see some of the funky stuff people have done in browsers.  The examples I've looked at also work in Firefox, so don't worry if you don't have Chrome installed.
